# Wordy Weapon - Player Guide

*A word-crafting roguelike where language is your weapon.*

---

## Chapter 1: Welcome to Etymos

### What is Wordy Weapon?

In the world of Etymos, words carry power. As a **Wordsmith**, you forge weapons from words to battle the Erratum—corrupted manifestations of broken language threatening the land.

### The Game Loop

1. **Forge** - Combine words into a weapon
2. **Fight** - Attack the enemy with your creation
3. **Shop** - Buy new words and upgrade your arsenal
4. **Repeat** - Progress through rounds, face tougher foes

### Your First Hero: Graham Moor

Graham is a Captain of the Guard—professional, precise, and skilled with a blade. He'll guide you through your first battles.

- **Strong Elements**: Physical, Earth
- **Weapon Proficiency**: Slash (Sword, Greatsword, Claymore)
- **Passive - Intimidating**: Enemies start with reduced HP

As you progress, you'll unlock more heroes with unique abilities and playstyles.

## Chapter 2: The Forge

The Forge is where you craft your weapon. Understanding it is key to victory.

### The 6 Slots

```
[Adj1] [Adj2] [Weapon] [Adj3] [Adj4] of [Noun]
```

- **Weapon Slot** (center): Your base weapon—Sword, Bow, Wand, or Mace variants
- **Adjective Slots** (4 slots): Modify your weapon with elements and rarities
- **Noun Slot** (gem): Adds a powerful word that gets bonus multipliers

### Example Weapon

```
Fiery Epic Greatsword of Phoenix
```
- Fiery = Fire element (adjective form)
- Epic = x2.5 damage multiplier
- Greatsword = T2 Slash weapon (2 AP)
- Phoenix = T3 Fire element in noun slot (3 AP, x2 W bonus)

### Word Tiers

Words come in three tiers that determine their power:

| Tier | AP (Attack Power) | Availability |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| T1 | 1 AP | Starting words, common in shops |
| T2 | 2 AP | Mid-game, moderate cost |
| T3 | 3 AP | Late-game, expensive but powerful |

### The Damage Formula

```
Damage = AP x W x Multipliers
```

- **AP** (Attack Power): Sum of all word tiers
- **W** (Word Count): Base count + bonuses from talents
- **Multipliers**: From rarity words, talents, and weaknesses

## Chapter 3: Elements & Weaknesses

### The 8 Elements

Elements are grouped into two families:

**World & Sky**
- Fire (orange)
- Water (blue)
- Lightning (yellow)
- Earth (brown)

**Body & Soul**
- Physical (gray)
- Poison (green)
- Light (gold)
- Dark (purple)

### Hitting Weaknesses

Every enemy has **weaknesses** and **resistances**:
- **Weakness**: 2x damage from that element
- **Resistance**: Reduced or nullified damage

Watch the enemy's element indicators! Matching your weapon to their weakness is often the difference between victory and defeat.

### Hero Elemental Affinity

Each hero has strong elements that synergize with their abilities. Using words that match your hero's strengths often triggers bonus effects from talents.

## Chapter 4: Heroes

### Starting Out

You begin with **Graham Moor**, a reliable warrior who excels at straightforward combat.

### Unlocking Heroes

New heroes unlock as you progress through the game. Each has:
- Unique **strong elements**
- A preferred **weapon type** (proficiency bonus)

- An ultimate **capstone power** (unlocked via skill tree)

### Playstyle Variety

Heroes encourage different strategies:
- Some favor stacking one element

- Some excel with minimal, precise weapons
- Some synergize with specific talent combinations

Experiment to find your favorite!

## Chapter 5: Talents & Synergies

### What Are Talents?

Talents are passive abilities you gain after victories. They modify how your forge works and can dramatically increase your power.

### Talent Categories

| Category | What They Do |
|----------|--------------|
| **Generators** | Add W (Word Count) to your pool |
| **Multipliers** | Multiply your final damage |
| **Retriggers** | REREAD words (add their contribution again) |
| **Converters** | Transform one resource into another |
| **Thresholds** | Trigger effects when you reach certain values |
| **Effects** | Bend the rules in unique ways |

### The REREAD Mechanic

REREAD is a special effect that adds a word's full contribution (AP + W) again. Multiple REREADs on the same word stack!

This is the key to explosive damage in the late game.

### Building Synergies

Talents are designed to chain together. The magic happens when you find combinations where:
- Generators fill your W pool
- Thresholds trigger when you hit milestones
- Retriggers add more contributions
- Converters transform those into multipliers

Discover your own devastating combos!

## Chapter 6: Economy & Tips

### Gold Management

- **Victory Gold**: Earn gold for defeating enemies
- **Interest**: Earn bonus gold based on your savings (every 10 gold = +1 interest)
- **Slot Interest**: Empty inventory slots also generate interest

### The Shop

Between battles, spend gold on:
- **Word Crates**: Random words from World & Sky or Body & Soul pools
- **Individual Words**: Sometimes specific words are for sale
- **Rerolls**: Refresh the shop selection (cost increases each time)

### Inventory Limits

- **Words**: Maximum 24 in your inventory
- **Consumables**: Maximum 2 at a time

Manage your collection carefully—sometimes selling is as important as buying.

### Beginner Tips

1. **Check weaknesses first** - Always look at the enemy's vulnerabilities before forging
2. **Tier up your weapons** - Higher tier weapons mean more base AP
3. **Don't ignore rarity words** - Common/Uncommon/Rare multipliers add up fast
4. **Fill the noun slot** - The gem slot has a built-in W multiplier
5. **Watch your talents** - Build around what you're offered
6. **Experiment!** - There's no single "correct" build

### Advanced Tips

1. **Element families matter** - Some talents reward using all World & Sky or all Body & Soul
2. **Word count talents scale** - More words = more W bonuses (usually)
3. **REREAD is king** - Late-game power spikes come from REREAD chains
4. **Gold has uses beyond buying** - Some talents convert gold to damage
