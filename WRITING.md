## Lore Bible

### The World: Etymos
A world where language is magic. Words carry power. The Great Library is the conduit for The Word - the binding force that flows through everything.

### The Tone
**Punny but fleshed out.** Terry Pratchett style: funny on the surface, surprisingly deep underneath. The world is full of wordplay, but it's a fully realized setting where puns are reality's fabric.

### The Theme
**Healthy language is the ability to communicate—to connect within society.**

Echoes **climate change**: local prosperity built on choices that harm the larger world. No singular villain—it's systemic. Verbia was wrong. Now they must reconcile with Prosa and with Etymos itself.

### No Singular Antagonist
The enemy is **systemic failure**:
- The Margin's construction
- Verbia's past choices
- The consequences of hoarding the Word

The Erratum are tragic—mindless abominations seeking purification, not villains with schemes.

## The Two Kingdoms

### Verbia - The Dominant Power
Beautiful, bustling capital. Everyone inside is happy. The Great Library at its heart.

**The Official Story**: "We founded the Kingdom. We protect The Word. Prosa started the war."

**The Truth**: Verbia displaced Prosa, took the Great Library, built walls, and rewrote history.

### Prosa - The Displaced
**Prosa was there first.** They lived alongside the Library. Then Verbia came, stronger and organized. Prosa was pushed to the margins.

**Sign Language**: Cut off from the Word, Prosa developed sign language—a survival adaptation. It doesn't require the Word, so Erratum cannot manifest from sign errors. Prosa's "silence" is resilience.

### The Great Library
The last bastion of all The Words. A living archive where books breathe and shelves rearrange.

**Before**: Served as purifier for all of Etymos, keeping meaning stable.

**After The Severing**: Only serves Verbia. Beyond its walls, corruption festered. Words twisted. The Erratum were born.

---

## The Threat: The Erratum

**Origin**: When Verbia built the Margin, the purification stopped flowing. Bad grammar, misspellings, broken syntax accumulated. The Erratum spawned from this corruption.

**Nature**: They are **not villains**. They are mindless, seeking purification. They want to be *corrected*. The tragic irony: they're trying to heal themselves, destroying everything in their path.

**The Truth**: Verbia created them. Only restoring the Word can save them.

## Character Voice Guidelines

### Graham Moor - Captain of the Guard
**Personality**: Professional, precise, hard shell. Cares deeply but expresses it through discipline.

**Arc**: Begins questioning his unbreakable duty when he realizes it's not tethered to a cause. When duty and bonds conflict, what wins?

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "I swing. You write. Simple."
- "Your spelling is a liability."
- "That's incorrect. ...Doesn't matter. Move out."

### Quivera - The Vigilante Bard
**Personality**: Independent, rhythmic, counts everything. Left the Guard because they were inefficient.

**Arc**: Saw the world outside Verbia's idle bliss. Couldn't unsee it. Left not from hate, but because she couldn't stand comfortable ignorance.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "One, two, three... release."
- "Your words set the tempo. I follow the beat."
- "Find the rhythm. Find the truth."

### Belle Lettres - Princess of Verbia
**Personality**: Looks like a dainty princess, acts like a recluse scholar. Rebellious in her quiet way. Has read the ancient texts and knows the truth about Verbia.

**Arc**: Her parents are missing in Prosa. Her kingdom's hands aren't clean. She carries this weight silently.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "Reality is a rough draft. I make revisions."
- "I've read this story before. The ending isn't pretty."
- "Knowledge is a burden. I carry it anyway."

### Alexandria Constanza - Paladin of The Great Library
**Personality**: Formal, poetic, steadfast. Grew up in the Library. Sworn to preserve ALL words.

**Arc**: Fresh from the Academy. As she learns the Library's true function and what the Margin has done, her oath evolves from institution to morality.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "Every entry matters. The lexicon endures."
- "I am sworn to The Word. All of it."
- "Some truths are preserved whether kingdoms wish it or not."

### Caesura - The Emissary from Prosa
**Personality**: Near-silent, speaks only when necessary. Named for the pause in poetry. Pronouns: they/them.

**Why Silent**: Sign language is their native tongue. They *can* speak, but it's not natural.

**The Truth**: Their people remember everything. They walk into the nation that displaced their ancestors, carrying a warning they didn't have to give.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "..."
- "We remember."
- "Your silence cost us everything. Now hear mine."

### Reed - The Ancient Druid
**Personality**: Patient, earthy, speaks in growth metaphors. Was alive before the war. Connected to Etymos through the land, not the Library.

**The Truth**: Saw it all. Theorized the Erratum could happen. His people have no voice in governance. He warned no one because no one would listen.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "Words have roots, Wordsmith. You help them grow."
- "I was here before the walls. I'll be here after."
- "The land remembers what the books forgot."

## Narrative Arc

### The Inciting Incident
The Erratum attack Prosa in force. Caesura arrives in Verbia with a warning. The King and Queen (Belle's parents) were on a diplomatic trip when the attack began. Their fate is unknown.

### Hero Reactions
- Belle believes Caesura (read the ancient texts)
- Quivera is open (has her own doubts)
- Graham is suspicious (outsider with warnings?)
- Alexandria is standoffish (but her oath may conflict)
- Reed has seen this before (the land is hurting)

### The Finale Vision
The heroes discover the Margin is the cause. The solution isn't destroying the Erratum—it's **restoring the Word**.

The Margin falls. The Word flows outward like a river of light. The Erratum run into the stream and are **purified**—not destroyed, but *healed*. The corruption dissolves. The words are made whole.

Verbia must face the world it abandoned. Reconciliation begins.
