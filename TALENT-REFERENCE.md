## Building Synergies

Talents are designed to chain together. Examples:

**REREAD Loop**: Gemination + Echo Chamber + Critical Mass + Crescendo
- Same-tier words trigger Gemination REREADs
- REREADs grant W from Echo Chamber
- T3 words add more REREADs via Critical Mass
- 6+ REREADs triggers Crescendo for REREAD ALL again

**Element Stack**: Synecdoche + Diacope + Cascade
- 4+ same element gives x4 from Synecdoche
- All 4 family elements triggers REREAD ALL
- Each unique element multiplies x1.5

**Minimalist**: Glass Cannon + Monolith + Anaphora
- Single T3 word gets x5 from Glass Cannon
- x4 from Monolith (all words T3)
- REREAD from Anaphora doubles contribution
