# Wordy Weapon - Worldbuilding Bible

## The World: Etymos, World of Words

### The Tone
**Punny but fleshed out.** The world is full of wordplay and linguistic humor, but it's not a joke—it's a fully realized setting where these puns are the actual fabric of reality. Think Terry Pratchett: funny on the surface, surprisingly deep underneath.

### The Theme
**Healthy language is the ability to communicate—to connect within society.** Verbia achieved this within their own bubble, at the great expense of the world of Etymos. Whether it was negligence or deliberate is ancient history now. We're just living with the current climate.

The story echoes **climate change**: local prosperity built on choices that harm the larger world. There's no singular villain to blame—it's systemic. Verbia was in the wrong. Now they must make amends: reconciliation with Prosa for the war, and with Etymos itself for cutting off its lifeforce.

**The central conflict is dissonance**—of language, of communication. The heroes themselves represent this dissonance. Caesura's warning was met with mixed reactions. Misunderstanding and distrust exist from top to bottom. The story is about overcoming that dissonance to act together.

### No Singular Antagonist
There is no Big Bad. The antagonist is **systemic**: the Margin, Verbia's past choices, the consequences of cutting off the Word. The Erratum are tragic—mindless abominations seeking purification, not villains with schemes. The human obstacles are the heroes themselves and their conflicting perspectives. The real enemy is the failure to communicate.

### The Word
**The Word** is the binding force of Etymos - like the Force in Star Wars. It flows through everything, gives language its power, shapes reality itself. The Great Library is its conduit.

**Word Mechanics:** In Etymos, words are more than just language—they carry magical affinity. A word can manifest itself into something tangible. A Wordsmith's craft is shaping that manifestation into a weapon. The magic is inherent to the word; the skill is in *imbuing* it effectively for maximum power. This is why Wordsmiths are rare and revered—anyone can speak, but few can forge.

### The Player: The Wordsmith
You are **The Wordsmith**—a legendary figure, already renowned for your ability to forge weapons from pure language. Heroes seek you out. The people revere you. You're not some nobody starting their journey; you're the best at what you do, and what you do is **write the wrongs** of the world.

Wordsmiths are rare. Most people can speak and write, but to forge words into weapons—to give language physical, destructive form—is a gift few possess. **The pen is mightier than the sword**, as they say. You are the living proof.

## The Two Kingdoms

### Verbia - The Dominant Power
A beautiful, bustling capital. Everyone inside the bubble is happy - prosperity, culture, The Great Library at its heart. But that comfort came at a cost no one talks about.

**The Official Story:** "We founded the Kingdom. We protect The Word. Prosa started the war."

**The Truth:** Verbia displaced Prosa, took The Great Library, built walls around it, and rewrote history to make themselves the rightful owners.

**The Margin:** The great wall that separates Verbia from the rest of Etymos. Built to "protect" the kingdom, it also severed the Great Library's purifying influence from the outside world.

### Prosa - The Displaced
**Prosa was there first.** They lived alongside The Great Library - perhaps they even built it, or it grew naturally from their land. The Word flowed freely.

Then Verbia came. Stronger, more organized. They saw the Library's power and took it. Prosa was pushed to the margins, restricted from the very Library that was once theirs. Now they're a "third-world" nation - far away, different culture (East vs West), and they remember everything Verbia wants forgotten.

**The Language of Prosa:** Cut off from the Word, Prosa developed differently. They evolved **sign language** as their primary means of communication—a natural survival adaptation. Any language or means of communication is valid, but sign language has one crucial advantage: **it doesn't require the Word, so Erratum cannot manifest from sign language errors.** Prosa's "silence" is not a weakness—it's resilience. They found another way.

### The Great Library
The last bastion and keepsake of all The Words. A living archive where books breathe, shelves rearrange themselves, and the architecture follows narrative logic. It's the conduit for The Word - the power of Etymos itself. Whoever controls it, controls everything.

**The Purifier:** Before the war, the Library served as a **purifier for all of Etymos**. Connected to the roots of language itself, it cleansed corruption from words, kept meaning stable, and prevented linguistic decay from festering into something dangerous. The Word flowed through it freely, to all.

**The Severing:** When Verbia built walls around the Library, they cut it off from Etymos. The purification stopped flowing outward. Now it only serves Verbia—if it works at all. Beyond the kingdom's borders, corruption began to fester. Words twisted. Grammar broke. Literary devices curdled into something alive and wrong. **The Unwritten were born from this severance.**

**Parallel:** Named to evoke the real Library of Alexandria - the library that burned, the knowledge lost, the weight of preservation. But here, the tragedy isn't destruction—it's hoarding.

---

## The Threat: The Erratum

**The Erratum** are not just corrupted words—they're deformed manifestations of linguistic errors, dead metaphors given shambling life, and grammatical mistakes made flesh.

**Their Origin:** When Verbia built the Margin and walled off the Great Library, the purification that once cleansed all of Etymos stopped flowing. Bad grammar, misspellings, broken syntax—corruption that would have been filtered away was left to fester. Over years, it piled up. The Erratum were born from this accumulation, spawning in the farthest corners of Etymos and inching closer to the Great Library.

**Their Nature:** The Erratum are **not villains**. They are **mindless abominations seeking purification**. They don't scheme or plot—they simply move toward the source of the Word, harming anything in their path. They want what Verbia hoarded. The tragic irony: they're trying to heal themselves, and they'll destroy everything to do it.

**The Tragic Truth:** The Erratum don't care about borders or history. They don't want to erase the world—they want to be *corrected*. But without the purifying flow of the Word, they can only seek it destructively. **Verbia created them, and only restoring the Word can save them.**

## The Heroes

### Graham Moor - Captain of the Guard
**Class:** Warrior
**Role:** Captain of Verbia's Guard
**Elements:** Physical/Earth | **Weapon:** Slash
**Capstone:** "Duty Bound"

**Personality:** Professional, precise, hard shell. Cares deeply about correctness but expresses it through discipline, not emotion. "That's wrong. Fix it." Not heartless, just compartmentalized. Follows orders - history is above his pay grade.

**The Arc:** Graham doesn't question his orders—but he begins to question his unbreakable sense of duty when he realizes it's not tethered to an actual *cause*. He cares about the Word and its preservation, but deep down, it's because of the bonds he's made: with Quivera, with his squad, with the people he protects. When duty and bonds conflict, what wins?

**Relationships:**
- Old friends with Quivera (haven't seen each other in a while, paths separated)
- Suspicious of Caesura - an outsider showing up with warnings?

**Speech Style:** Short. Declarative. Corrects your grammar, pretends he doesn't care.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "I swing. You write. Simple."
- "Your spelling is a liability."
- "That's incorrect. ...Doesn't matter. Move out."

---

### Quivera - The Vigilante Bard
**Class:** Ranger/Bard
**Role:** Ex-Guard turned solo vigilante, traveling bard
**Elements:** Lightning/Earth | **Weapon:** Pierce
**Capstone:** "Last Arrow"

**Personality:** Independent, rhythmic, counts everything. Left the Guard because they were inefficient - she does things at her own pace. Travels Etymos broadening her horizons, playing her music, hunting Erratum.

**The Arc:** Quivera saw the world outside Verbia's idle bliss and couldn't unsee it. She knew Verbia was sitting on its hands while there was a whole world out there. She left not because she hates her homeland, but because she couldn't stand the comfortable ignorance. She still loves Verbia—she just knows better now.

**Relationships:**
- Old friends with Graham (their paths separated)
- More open to hearing Caesura out than others

**Speech Style:** Rhythmic, measured, musical. Counting references.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "One, two, three... release."
- "Your words set the tempo. I follow the beat."
- "Find the rhythm. Find the truth."

---

### Belle Lettres - Princess of Verbia
**Class:** Mage
**Role:** Crown Princess, secret bookworm of The Great Library
**Elements:** Body & Soul strong (Phys/Poison/Light/Dark), World & Sky weak (Fire/Water/Earth/Lightning)
**Weapon:** Magic
**Passive:** "Well-Read" — Body & Soul words: +2 AP, World & Sky words: -2 AP
**Capstone:** "Knowledge Eternal" — All words trigger twice (REREAD ×1)

**Archetype:** The sheltered princess who knows too much. Think Beauty (Beauty and the Beast) meets Elizabeth (Bioshock Infinite)—a girl trapped in a gilded cage of books, yearning for the world outside, burdened by knowledge she never asked for.

**Personality:** Looks like a dainty princess, acts like a recluse scholar. Spends her days in the Great Library instead of court. Rebellious in her own quiet way - doesn't conform to the role she was born with. Masks her avoidant nature with royal training and vast knowledge. Has read extensively about the internal world—emotion, mortality, the spirit—but nature remains abstract theory to her. She knows about dragons but has never felt their fire.

**The Truth:** Has read the real ancient texts. Knows what Verbia did to Prosa. Carries that weight silently - it's partly why she's avoidant. Her kingdom's hands aren't clean.

**Relationships:**
- Receptive to Caesura's warning - she's read about the Unwritten before
- Knows more than she lets on about everything

**Speech Style:** Elegant, detached, meta-textual. References drafts, revisions, edits.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "Reality is a rough draft. I make revisions."
- "I've read this story before. The ending isn't pretty."
- "Knowledge is a burden. I carry it anyway."

---

### Alexandria Constanza - Paladin of The Great Library
**Class:** Paladin
**Role:** Templar sworn to The Word and The Great Library
**Elements:** Light/Physical | **Weapon:** Blunt
**Capstone:** "Sacred Flame"

**Personality:** Formal, poetic, steadfast. Grew up in the Library. Her will is unshakeable. Sworn to preserve ALL words - her oath is to The Word itself.

**The Arc:** Alexandria's oath is all she knows. Fresh from the Academy, she's finally fulfilling her life's purpose: to preserve the Great Library. But her conflict is internal. As she learns more about the Library's true function—and what the Margin has done—her oath evolves. It's no longer an idle pledge to an institution. Her oath aligns with her *morality*. She gains proper resolve: she fights the Erratum not for her oath, but for herself, her family and friends, and life as she knows it.

**Relationships:**
- Standoffish about Caesura initially
- Devoted to the Library above all else

**Speech Style:** Archival, oath-bound, poetic. Formal declarations.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "Every entry matters. The lexicon endures."
- "I am sworn to The Word. All of it."
- "Some truths are preserved whether kingdoms wish it or not."

---

### Caesura - The Emissary from Prosa
**Class:** Assassin
**Role:** Mysterious emissary from the displaced nation of Prosa
**Elements:** Dark/Poison | **Weapon:** Pierce
**Pronouns:** They/them (gender unknown, adds to mystery)
**Capstone:** "Final Silence"

**Personality:** Near-silent, speaks only when necessary. Every word counts. Communicates through what they *don't* say. Named for the pause in poetry - they strike in the spaces between words.

**Why Silent:** Caesura's silence isn't mysterious affectation—it's how language developed in Prosa. Cut off from the Great Library, Prosa evolved sign language as their primary communication. Caesura *can* speak, but sign language is their native tongue. They speak more naturally with their hands.

**The Truth:** Their people remember everything. Prosa was there first. Caesura walks into the nation that displaced their ancestors, carrying a warning they didn't have to give.

**Relationships:**
- Animosity with Graham and Alexandria (generational trauma, not petty beef)
- Belle is receptive to them
- The tension is *loaded*

**Speech Style:** Minimal. Elliptical. Significant pauses. Every syllable carries weight.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "..."
- "We remember."
- "Your silence cost us everything. Now hear mine."

---

### Reed - The Ancient Druid
**Class:** Druid
**Role:** Ancient guardian of Etymos itself
**Elements:** Earth/Water | **Weapon:** Blunt
**Capstone:** "One With Nature"

**Personality:** Patient, earthy, speaks in growth metaphors. Was alive before Verbia, before the war, when the Library was built. Connected to Etymos on a deeper level than anyone - not through the Library, but through the land itself.

**The Truth:** Saw it all. Knows the full history. Has an opinion - he didn't like the war, knows it upset Etymos. The Great Library is a conduit for The Word, and that conflict scarred the land.

**The Erratum:** Reed theorized this could happen. He understands how vital the Great Library's connection to Etymos truly is. But he's a lone druid—his people are respected and preserved, but the times have passed them by. They have no pull in governance, no voice in the halls of power. He warned no one because no one would have listened.

**His Unique Connection:** Before the Library existed, the Word flowed freely through Etymos—uncontrolled, natural, but not preserved. The Great Library ensured preservation for all of Etymos. Reed isn't opposed to the Library; he understands its purpose. But he knew the Word *before* it was institutionalized. He has a more fundamental understanding of its organic mechanics. Through him, the heroes may discover what the Library is built upon—and what creates the natural resource of the Word itself.

**Status:** A relic. A native of a world that moved on without him. But perhaps the only one who understands how to restore balance.

**Speech Style:** Naturalistic, patient, growth metaphors, linguistic evolution.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "Words have roots, Wordsmith. You help them grow."
- "I was here before the walls. I'll be here after."
- "The land remembers what the books forgot."

## Story Tension

### The Inciting Incident
The Erratum have been building beyond The Margin for years—corruption festering in the lands Verbia abandoned. Now they've gone berserk, attacking Prosa in force.

Caesura arrives in Verbia with a warning. Their reception is mixed, but the kingdom is forced to act: **the King and Queen (Belle's parents) were on a diplomatic trip to Prosa when the attack began.** Their fate is unknown. Caesura assures they're alive and safe, but they cannot return until the threat is contained.

With the monarchy's fate uncertain beyond The Margin, Verbia must respond.

### Hero Reactions to Caesura's Warning
- **Belle** believes them (read the ancient texts, knows the history) — **the narrative protagonist**
- **Quivera** is open to hearing them out (has her own doubts about Verbia)
- **Graham** is suspicious (an outsider? with warnings? following orders to be cautious)
- **Alexandria** is standoffish (but her oath to The Word may conflict with loyalty to Verbia)
- **Reed** has seen this all before (knows more than anyone, the land itself is hurting)

The Erratum don't care about the conflict between Verbia and Prosa. They want to erase everything.

### Narrative vs. Gameplay
- **Graham** is the starter hero from a gameplay standpoint (accessible warrior archetype)
- **Belle** is the narrative protagonist (knows the truth, her parents are at stake, her kingdom's sins are coming due)
- **Bosses are a gameplay mechanic** — they provide challenge and hero unlocks, but the game doesn't include a linear story mode

### The Finale (Vision)
The heroes discover that the Margin is the cause of everything. The solution isn't destroying the Erratum—it's **restoring the Word**.

In an epic climax, **the Margin falls**. The Word flows outward from the Great Library like a river of light, spreading across Etymos for the first time in generations. The Erratum—those mindless, suffering abominations—run into the stream and are **purified**. They don't die screaming; they are *healed*. The corruption dissolves. The words are made whole again.

It's cathartic. Redemptive. The tragedy of the Erratum was never that they were monsters—it was that they were broken words that just wanted to be *correct*.

Verbia must now face the world it abandoned. Reconciliation with Prosa begins. The Word flows freely once more.

## Additional Locations

### The Erratum Wastes
A corrupted landscape where reality breaks down into scattered letters and broken words. Floating fragments of destroyed pages drift through an ink-black sky torn with paper clouds. Skeletal remains of a once-great civilization litter the ground. This is where language goes to die—the furthest extent of the corruption caused by The Severing.
